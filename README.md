### What is this?
This is an easily-configurable discord polling bot. It automates the process of making polls and counting votes, but most importantly, it shows the names of the users which voted.

### How do I invite the bot to my server?
Just paste the link below into a new browser tab! <br>
`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=799514035636535297&permissions=537258048&scope=bot`

### How do I set this up myself?
1. Download the repository
2. Go to the `db` directory
3. Get a bot token from `https://discord.com/developers`
4. Make a file called `token.txt` in the directory
5. Paste your token into the file
6. Run main.py

To change the appearance, go to `db/ui.cfg` and edit the options.<br>
To change the token, go to start.py and change the `}` in `Bot = bot.Bot("}", client)` to whatever you want your prefix to be.
